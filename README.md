# IMDB-Movies-EDA

My project aims to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the top 1000 movies on IMDb to gain valuable insights into the film industry. By examining this dataset, we seek to answer research questions such as identifying the most popular genres, directors, and actors among top-rated movies, understanding how gross revenue varies by decade, and exploring the relationships between IMDb ratings, Metascore, number of votes, and gross revenue. Additionally, we will analyze how movie runtimes have changed over the years and determine which film durations were more popular in different decades. These insights can help filmmakers, studios, and streaming services make informed decisions on investments and production strategies, as well as guide audiences in selecting movies worth watching. Ultimately, this analysis will provide substantial data on audience preferences and market dynamics, benefiting both production houses and investors.
